        content: `'''Katherine Louise Bouman''' (born 1989) is an American [[engineer]] and [[computer scientist]] working in the field of [[computational imaging]]. She led the development of an [[algorithm]] for imaging [[black hole]]s, known as [[CHIRP (algorithm)|Continuous High-resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors]] (CHIRP), and was a member of the [[Event Horizon Telescope]] team that captured the first image of a black hole.

== Early life and education ==
Bouman grew up in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. Her father, [[Charles Bouman]], is a professor of [[electrical and computer engineering]] and [[biomedical engineering]] at [[Purdue University]].

== Research and career ==
After earning her doctorate, Bouman joined [[Harvard University]] as a [[postdoctoral fellow]] on the Event Horizon Telescope Imaging team. She led the development of an algorithm for imaging black holes, known as [[CHIRP (algorithm)|Continuous High-resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors]] (CHIRP).

== Recognition ==
She was recognized as one of the [[BBC]]'s [[100 Women (BBC)#2019|100 women of 2019]]. In 2024, Bouman was awarded a [[Sloan Research Fellowship]].`
